## Story Board ##

Scene 1:
Widescreen shot of a metro bay area city during the long hot summer that plagues the concrete forest. A pan shot leads to a zoom in on the local frozen yogurt shop where our three main characters are introduced.

Scene 2:
Sliced fruit is flying everywhere as if someone was playing fruit ninja live. The sounds of blades as slicing as if someone was getting away with murder is heard off camera. A pan shot to Sacho showing him prepare toppings for the yogurt. Sacho shouts to the back asking for more fruit.

Scene 3:
The curtain from the kitchen area shreds open standing in the garden gnome-size shadows, you see a shuffle with a deep throaty dwarven comeback. Noc mumbles a few things more as he grumply grabs more fruit from the back.

Scene 4:
Lately and somehow covered with an oddly distinct smell, the front door is heard quietly open as you see the top of Swak's hair pan accross the screen as if ninja'ly sneaking into work. Red-eyed he doesn't even notice the oddly hungry customer waiting near Sacho's counter. As he heads to the back employee doors to clock in.

Scene 5:
Reverting the attention back to Sacho catching fruit from Noc's perfect pitches from the back, a shadow begins to block out Sacho where he couldn't ignore but think a customer was waiting for him to ring them up. As he turns with the classic "is that all for ya today?", an upwards pan shot to the mysterious figure shows a gruesome face. Panicked he scuffles back and throw several banana's at the clawing customer.

Scene 6
Noc seeing Sacho scramble, peers thru the windowed area that allows him to see the dining area. Noc hops onto the yogurt toppings counter and pulls in a deep breath. A deep shout (dragon breath special move) and the zombie is destroyed into pieces.

Scene 7
The front window of the shop suddenly darkens as tons of bodies press against the glass. Sacho and Noc head to the backdoor as they grab Swak still putting on his apron. As quick as the door opens, tons of green hands come reaching back through. Sacho slams the door shut.

Scene 8
Realizing they are cornered in the shop, a sight of panic and survey of the area happens with the 3 guys. Something jumps out at the guys that hints them to take safety in the walk-in freezer. Sacho secures them inside as they find a way to get into this secret room beneath the freezer.

Scene 9
They find an old military bunker that has supplies left over from some old forgotten war. Preparing to revisit the surface they arm up to the teeth and this prepares us to enter the first level. Where do they go from here?
